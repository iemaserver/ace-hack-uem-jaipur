      <p>
      This March, ACM-UEM Chapter proudly announces the comeback of our in-person hackathon with AceHack 2.0!
      <br />
      We aspire to empower our student community and encourage students to realize their potential in safe spaces.
      <br />
      Our hackathon`s motto, “Dream It, Hack It”, epitomizes these aspirations and encourages hackers to free themselves from their inhibitions and make their dreams come to life. 
      <br />
      We believe the most significant prize any student can win is knowing that they have what it takes to create beautiful work from the most basic blocks: ones and zeros.
